Simple Free RSA / AES Encryption and Decryption

Simple Free Encryption Tool (sfet) uses RSA and AES versions that are strong and allow encryption between client-side Javascript, Node.js and C#.

Open and free for all to see, can be run stand-alone on a local machine for an extra sense of security; all functionality runs entirely locally once the page has been loaded.
Latest client version be loaded directly from the GitHub repo [here](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/therightstuff/simple-free-encryption-tool/blob/master/dist/index.html).

## Encryption 101

RSA encryption operates on a very limited string length, it is generally used to asymmetrically encrypt a shared secret that in turn is used for symmetric encryption. The standard use-case is to generate a random shared secret and transmit it encrypted with the destination's public RSA key. Once the destination has decrypted the shared secret with its private RSA key both sides will be able to use that secret to encrypt and decrypt communication with AES.

Signing a message to prove authorship (and that it hasn't been tampered with) is performed on the plaintext message, and the resulting signature can only be verified with the public key matching the private key it was signed with. The padding for signing and verifying signatures is not the same as for encrypting and decrypting messages.

## Important Notes

The AES secret must be a 32 character string. In order to ensure a valid string, the provided secret is always hashed using the MD5 algorithm to produce a string of the correct length.

The IV, or Initialization Vector, is a 16 character hexadecimal string that's required by the AES algorithm ([read this](https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/3965/what-is-the-main-difference-between-a-key-an-iv-and-a-nonce) for a detailed explanation). It's not really necessary when encryption secrets aren't being reused, but as it's enforced by the underlying crypto package it's recommended to include it. If you do choose to leave it out, a default IV of '0000000000000000' will be used.

Signing messages and verifying signatures with simple-free-encryption-tool are performed using the SHA-256 hashing algorithm.
